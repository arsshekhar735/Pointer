## 📂 **Repository Structure**

Here's the breakdown of what you’ll find in each file:

- `point.cpp`: **The Basics of Pointers**  
  Learn what pointers are, how they are declared, and how to use them with variables.
  
- `pointer_Array.cpp`: **Pointers with Arrays**  
  Dive into how pointers and arrays are related and how you can manipulate array elements with pointers.
  
- `char_pointer.cpp`: **Pointers with Characters**  
  Explore how pointers work with strings and character arrays, and how they help manage memory efficiently.

## 🏆 **Why Should You Care About Pointers?**

Pointers are **essential** to mastering C++ programming. They allow you to:

- Access and manipulate memory directly.
- Handle dynamic memory allocation.
- Pass large data structures (like arrays or structs) to functions efficiently.

They’re powerful tools, and understanding them will open up the full potential of C++.
